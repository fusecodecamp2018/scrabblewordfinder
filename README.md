# Scrabble Word Finder

Plan
1.) Ice Breaker activity
  * split into 2 teams and play a couple rounds of scrabble?
2.) Short discussion of scripting (do you what scripting is? are you aware of terminal?)
3.) Intro to pseudocode and collectively write the Scrabble psuedocode
4.) Intro to terminal, basic navigation
5.) Intro to Ruby, basic script execution
6.) BREAK - activity? (not "official" break, just something fun)
7.) The rest of it
8.) Lesson review
9.) Open-forum discussion on technology and programming - 15/20 minutes
10.) Show and Tell
    * 1 kid volunteer to show off script
    * Scrabble tile bag - have 7 kids select a random tile
    * Use those 7 letters to generate best word

=== Notes ====
* For code, do verbal test-driven development (not writing tests, but talking about expected outputs)

TODO
* purchase scrabble - aaron
* interim break activities - both
* assignments? - both
* how to break-up code - Lavan
* take-home activities - aaron
